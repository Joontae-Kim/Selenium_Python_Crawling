					<h3>Install Seleium package.</h3>
					<p> My work is based on MacOS, Python. And i use Sublime Text2.
					Anyway, you can download Python setup file under python official site and you can see proper setup file to your OS. usually I use python 2.x version <br> - https://www.python.org/downloads/</p>

					<h3>Install Seleium package.</h3>
					<p><cite>Selenium automates browsers. That's it! What you do with that power is entirely up to you. Primarily, it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should!) also be automated as well.</cite>by http://www.seleniumhq.org/</p>
					<p>To install, write <code>pip install selenium</code> In command shell</p>
					<p>If you want to check whether installed or not, write under some code. </p>
					<code>python2</code>
					<code>>>>import selenium</code> 
					<code>>>>selenium__version__</code> 
				</li>

					<h3>Install Seleium WebDriver.</h3>
					<p>Seleium WebDriver is a bridge between OS and Web Browser. If you want to use Seleium WebDriver, you have to choose a right version both OS and Web Browser.
					<br><cite>The biggest change in Selenium recently has been the inclusion of the WebDriver API. Driving a browser natively as a user would either locally or on a remote machine using the Selenium Server it marks a leap forward in terms of browser automation.</cite>by http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/</p>
